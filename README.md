# Apex-Tools-and-Rental-Services-ITM90B-Data-Project

For my graduation project, our group was given a case study about a fictional tool rental store called Apex Tools and Rental Services (ATSR) that wanted a digital presence to serve larger organizations on construction projects (where people and organizations can order tools online). To do this, they wanted to upgrade their existing ERP system (named TRMS). 
We created a database using MS SQL to design a schema that best accomated their needs. After, we then queried the database for key insights (after generating data for the database using Devart). For this project, you find the SQL script for our database schema, and you will also see code that I wrote to query the database for inights (professor had given us things to find within the database).
